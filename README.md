# Environmental modelling factors preparation

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks designed for the preparation of various environmental datasets for use in remote sensing, agriculture, climate studies, and environmental modeling. All data utilized in these workflows is accessed and processed through Google Earth Engine (GEE), a powerful platform that enables efficient and scalable analysis of large geospatial datasets. Thanks to GEE for providing access to these valuable datasets.

## Notebooks Overview
### Sentinel-2-data-preparation.ipynb
This notebook provides a workflow for accessing and preparing Sentinel-2 multispectral data from GEE, focusing on spectral bands relevant to vegetation indices like NDVI. It includes cloud masking, spatial/temporal resampling, and preprocessing steps essential for environmental and agricultural analysis.

### climate-features-preparation.ipynb
This notebook focuses on extracting climate-related features (temperature, precipitation, etc.) from GEE's extensive climate data archives. Data cleaning, anomaly handling, and feature engineering are covered to create a robust climate dataset for integrated analyses.

### Sentinel-1-feature-preparation.ipynb
Here, youâ€™ll find methods for processing Sentinel-1 SAR data accessed from GEE. The notebook includes steps like radiometric calibration, terrain correction, and noise reduction, as well as extracting features like backscatter coefficients, which are critical for applications in vegetation and soil moisture studies.

### MODIS-vegetation-condition.ipynb
This notebook demonstrates how to prepare MODIS vegetation condition data, specifically NDVI and EVI indices, from GEE. It focuses on time-series analysis and anomaly detection, allowing for the monitoring of vegetation health over time.

### soil-attributes-preparation.ipynb
Using soil attribute datasets available on GEE, this notebook details the preparation of soil parameters (e.g., texture, organic matter) for environmental modeling. It covers data cleaning, unit standardization, and spatial alignment.

### Landsat-data-preparation.ipynb
This notebook covers the processing of Landsat imagery from GEE. It includes steps like radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, and cloud masking, and shows how to derive spectral indices useful for land cover and ecosystem analysis.

###  terrain-feature-preparation.ipynb
This notebook focuses on deriving terrain features (elevation, slope, aspect) from digital elevation models available in GEE. These features are essential for hydrological and erosion studies and are processed to align with other environmental datasets.

By leveraging GEE, these notebooks streamline access to vast, high-quality environmental datasets, supporting efficient data preparation for a wide range of research and modeling applications.
